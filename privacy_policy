  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    The B Good Group LLC (“<strong>Company</strong>,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) operates
    a private integration that connects QuickBooks Online (“<strong>QBO</strong>”)
    to our automation platform n8n. This page explains what data we collect, how
    we use it, and the choices you have.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OAuth tokens</strong> (access &amp; refresh) received from Intuit after you grant permission.</li>
    <li><strong>Company (Realm) ID</strong> identifying your QBO company.</li>
    <li><strong>Basic accounting data</strong> needed to create invoices: customer names/IDs,
        invoice numbers, line-item amounts, dates, and service descriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Log entries</strong> generated by n8n (timestamps, success/failure messages).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use the data solely to automate invoice creation and related bookkeeping
     tasks you have explicitly requested. We do <em>not</em> sell or share your
     QuickBooks data with third parties for advertising or analytics.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tokens are encrypted at rest inside n8n’s credential store.</li>
    <li>Workflow logs and temporary data reside in our private cloud instance hosted by n8n.cloud.</li>
    <li>Access is restricted to vetted Company personnel via MFA-protected accounts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain OAuth tokens and minimal invoice metadata for as long as the
     automation remains active or until you request deletion.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may revoke the integration at any time from within QuickBooks
        (<em>Apps → Settings → Disconnect</em>) or by emailing us.</li>
    <li>You may request deletion of stored tokens and logs by contacting us
        at <a href="mailto:support@thebgoodgroup.com">support@thebgoodgroup.com</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this page occasionally. We will post any changes here
     and update the “Last updated” date above.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
